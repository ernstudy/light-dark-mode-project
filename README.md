This "light dark mode" webpage project I learned to develop with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
following a tutorial on Udemy focuses on providing users with the option to choose between a light and dark mode to suit their preferences.
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,I followed the detailed steps in the tutorial to implement this functionality. 
I started by structuring the content with HTML, then used CSS to design the styles for both light and dark modes.
Finally, I employed JavaScript to manage the switch between the two modes, using click events to toggle between the corresponding CSS classes.
The tutorial also addressed techniques for storing the user's preference locally, allowing the page to remember the mode selection even after the user closes and reopens the browser.
This project provided me with a solid understanding of how to create a dynamic and adaptable user experience through the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
